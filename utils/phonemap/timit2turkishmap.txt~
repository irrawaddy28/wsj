; col 1: timit phones in Worldbet (Kaldi resolved)

; col 3: corresponding turkish phones in Worldbet (Kaldi resolved). If exact match exists, write exact match. Otherwise, set match to #0 (meaning no match). WARNING: This col has not been tested on Kaldi.
; col 4: timit phones in Worldbet (HTK resolved)
; col 5: corresponding turkish phones in Worldbet (HTK resolved). If exact match exists, write exact match. Otherwise, make an approximate match

;
; Example: 
; "aI	a   #0"
; This means the dipthong "aI" in timit has an approximate match with "A" in turkish if col 2 is used and no 
; match in turkish if col 3 is used. The turkish language does not have any dipthongs. Col 3, being more restrictive, sets 
; the match to #0. But col 2, being less restrictive, allows approximate match to "A". 
;
; To know how many phones in the full Turkish set have been mapped from TIMIT, use:
; > comm -12 <(cat metu2worldmap.txt|sed '/;/d' |awk '{print $2}'|sort -u) <(cat timit2turkishmap.txt|sed '/;/d'|awk '{print $2}'| sort -u)|wc -l
;
;
; To know how many phones in the full Turkish set have not been mapped from TIMIT, use:
; > comm -23 <(cat metu2worldmap.txt|sed '/;/d'|awk '{print $2}'|sort -u) <(cat timit2turkishmap.txt|sed '/;/d'|awk '{print $2}'|sort -u)|wc -l
;
; Sanity check: The sum of both the above quantities should be equal to the number of phones present in the full Turkish set.
;
; To check for typos while entering the mapped phones, use:
; > comm -13 <(cat metu2worldmap.txt|sed '/;/d' |awk '{print $2}'|sort -u) <(cat timit2turkishmap.txt|sed '/;/d'|awk '{print $2}'| sort -u)|wc -l
;
; The result of this must be 0. Otherwise, you entered wrong mapped phone(s).
