; In this file, phonemes in METUbet are mapped to their corresponding representations in WORLDbet.
; In addition, for each mapping, a brief description of the articulatory features is given.
; This is to resolve any ambiguity in phoneme symbols by placing greater emphasis on the
; knowledge of articulators rather than on symbols. Secondly, such articulatory
; information can be used to construct left-right questions for decision tree clustering.
; Lines starting with the semi-colon(;) are comments. These lines are not processed.
; 
; Some Definitions:
; Approximant is produced by narrowing the vocal tract at the place of articulation, but not enough to produce a turbulent airstream like fricative. An approximant is a consonant and can be split into two types: central approximant (glide) and lateral approximant (liquid). An approximant is more popularly known as a semivowel although it is found in the IPA table of consonants!! A glide (y in yet, w in watch) is similar to a dipthong (vowels can be split into monopthongs and dipthongs. Dipthong e.g. the sound of ow in down, crown) due to its articulatory transition from source to a destination but it is not a vowel since it does not form the nucleus of a syllable like a dipthong. In a spectrogram, a dipthong will have distinct F2 and F3. A glide also has F2 and F3 but they approach each other with F2 rising and F3 falling forming an X-shaped pattern. Therefore, glides and dipthongs are similar in the acoustic sense (due to F2-F3) and differ in the psychological sense (due to syllable nucleus).
; Trill is produced by directing air over the articulator so that it vibrates.
; A lateral consonant (lateral approximant) is produced by directing the airstream over the sides of the tongue, rather than down the middle (e.g. l in land)
; A retroflexed place of articulation occurs when the tip of the tongue curled up, but more generally, 
; it means that it is palato-alveolar (which means the same thing as postalveolar) without being palatalized. 
; Strident or Sibilant: A type of consonant produced by manner of articulation where it produced by an obstruction placed
; in front of the turbulent air stream caused by frication. Hence, strident = frication + obstruction.
; Obstruction typically means the tongue is curled lengthwise to direct the air over the edge of the teeth.
; It is sometimes called as sibilant. Stridents typically occur in fricatives and affricates.
; Examples: s (sat), sh (ship) are strident unv fricatives, z (zoo)/ zh (azure) are strident voiced fricatives,
; ch (church) is strident unv affricate, dz (judge) is strident voiced affricate
; f (fat)/ v (van) are non-strident voiced and unvoiced fricatives respectively.

; Col 1: METUBET phone set
; Col 2: WORLDBET phone set (Kaldi resolved)
; Col 3: WORLDBET phone set (HTK resolved)
;
; Kaldi phones:
; Kaldi phones are of the form <one or more non-numeric chars><optional: one or more numeric characters>
; E.g. 3r, n3r are not acceptable but r3, nr3 are acceptable since digits can only trail.
; To resolve Kaldi issues with some of the WORLDBET phones, the WORLDBET phones were further mapped to new
; symbols. Therefore, the mapping looks like this: TIMIT -> WORLDBET -> Kaldi resolved WORLDBET.  
; er  -> 3r	-> threer  (digits can only trail)
; r  -> 9	-> nine	   (digits can only trail)	
; dx -> d(	-> dop     (no open or closed parenthesis due to issues in scoring routines, e.g. tools/sctk/bin/csrfilt.sh/ validateOptDelTags() will return "error" if WORLDBET flapped symbols like b(, d(, g( etc. are used );
; OE -> 8 -> eight
;
; HTK phones:
; To resolve HTK issues with some of the WORLDBET phones, the WORLDBET phones were further mapped to a new
; symbols. Those phones are:
; METU -> WORLDBET -> HTK resolved WORLDBET
; a) OE -> 8 -> uh8   (Using 8 resulted in errors using HLed. HLed does not accept numbers as phones)
; b) RR -> r( -> r1   (Using r( resulted in errors using HParse as it does not accept r( in the input grammar file)
; c) V ->  V[ -> V3   (Using V[ resulted in errors using HParse as it does not accept V[ in the input grammar file)
